# graph

graph is a minimalist approach to training gpt models to predict directly on the web; it works by using the power of a gpu through pytorch, exporting it and then loading it into a simple javascript client.

this project is meant to ease the pain for newcomers to the ai world, for them to easily experiment with datasets as and different architectures and potentially making them accesible (maybe even commercial) through web technologies.

it comes with two main files:

- graph.py: to train your models using pytorch
- graph.js: to use your model on web browsers

this is a simple demo for people to have a glance on how to train and small model to train small model on predicting the next token.
